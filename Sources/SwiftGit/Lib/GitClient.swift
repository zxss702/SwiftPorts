/// the `ForgeKit` protocol is referred to in fully-qualified form
/// below to disambiguate.
///
/// `GitClient` is the **sandbox-aware face** over the pure
/// `SwiftGitCore.Repository` SDK: every operation authorizes the paths it
/// will touch through ``ShellKit/Shell/authorize(_:)``, bridges the
/// sandbox environment to libgit2's process-global options
/// (`Libgit2Sandboxing`), opens the repository, and delegates to the
/// corresponding `Repository` method. The core SDK itself performs no
/// gating and reads no ambient shell state — hosts that don't need a
/// sandbox use `SwiftGitCore` directly.
///
/// Drop-in replacement for `ProcessGitClient` that doesn't need a `git`
/// binary on `PATH`. Works on macOS / iOS / tvOS / watchOS — anywhere
/// libgit2 builds.
///
/// Caveats vs the user's system git: HTTPS auth uses libgit2's built-in
/// http parser + SecureTransport; SSH auth uses libgit2's `GIT_SSH_EXEC`
/// path which still shells out to the system `ssh`. Neither honours the
/// user's `gitconfig` `credential.helper` — for token-bearing pushes,
/// embed the token in the URL or call `addRemote` with one.
